Graphic designer, printmaker, illustrator, and cat enthusiast.
I’ve been a creator since before I can even remember. As a kid, I would sit on my bedroom floor for hours, drawing and making things without any regard for time or the outside world. I’ve always loved the feeling when someone gets excited about something I’ve made – it’s a natural rush. It’s also the reason I love design so much. I’m passionate about creating products that excite people.
